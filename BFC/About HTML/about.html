<b><u>The Beryl Ford Collection:</u></b>
Local historian Beryl Ford collected the largest and most significant collection of photographs and artifacts relevant to the history of the City of Tulsa and surrounding area throughout his lifetime. We are fortunate that he shared part of his legacy as Tulsa historian with us in the form of this invaluable collection, now available online on the Tulsa City-County Library's website.  This collection was made possible by the Rotary Club of Tulsa.  
<br/><br/>The Tulsa Then &amp; Now: Mapping the BFC app contains around 300 of the over 22,000 photos contained in The Beryl Ford Collection. To browse the entire collection visit the <a href="http://www.tulsalibrary.org/bfc/">Beryl Ford Collection online</a>.
